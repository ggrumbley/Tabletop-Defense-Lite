# Tabletop-Defense-Lite
Community version of my VR tower defense game <a href="https://harmonicminor.itch.io/tabletop-defense">Tabletop Defense</a>.

Uses <a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/32647">SteamVR</a> and <a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/64131">VRTK</a>

Clone or download, open in unity (currently using version 2017.2.0f3), wait for unity to build libraries.

Use as a basis for your game, as a tutorial, or add some new features/maps and send me a pull request.  Linking back here and to the itch.io game is appreciated if you use my code.

I am currently going through and fixing all the issues that were caused by removing numerous paid assets that cannot be included (probuilder, mech constructor, rewired, master audio, third person controller, fx packs, sound fx, vrweapons, and numerous textures), and updating the game from version 5.5 of unity.  It should play without errors, but many features are missing/disabled.
